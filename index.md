## About Me

<p style="font-family: Roboto Condensed"> I'm a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie postdoctoral research fellow at Edinburgh University. You can read about my project 'GRASP: Greater Awareness of Social Pragmatics in Ageing' below.	
										
		Prior to this fellowship I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics examining multimodal communication in interactive settings and a postdoc at the University of Oslo exploring referential communication across various populations, languages, and ages. My PhD thesis (at Edinburgh Uni) examined the cognitive mechanisms underlying perspective-taking over the lifespan and the impact of later-life language learning on cognitive ageing.
