## About Me

I'm a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Edinburgh. You can read about my project 'GRASP: Greater Awareness of Social Pragmatics in Ageing' below. Prior to this, I was a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics (examining multimodal communication in interactive settings) and at the University of Oslo (exploring referential communication across the lifespan, across clinical and non-clinical populations, and cross-linguistically). My PhD thesis at the University of Edinburgh examined the cognitive mechanisms underlying perspective-taking over the lifespan and the impact of later-life language learning on cognitive ageing. 



## Research Programme

I have developed a research programme I call <i>lifespan pragmatics</i>, which addresses questions at the intersection of experimental pragmatics and cognitive ageing using experimental and computational methods. The main goal of my research programme is to uncover the factors (cognitive, linguistic and social) underlying our ability to read between the lines in conversation and adapt speech in partner-specific ways, a cornerstone of human communication which varies significantly at each stage of development.
