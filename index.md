## About Me
My original first name is _**Êù∞ (Jie)**_. Please see this [link](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ji%C3%A9) with audio to learn how to pronounce Jie ("JEE-yeh" is pretty close). 

My undergraduate study ([ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home)) and master study were done both in Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/). I received my PhD in System Engineering at [George Washington University](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/). My PhD dissertation is titled ["Towards Formalizing Data-Driven Decision-Making from Big Data: A Systematic Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Approach in Online Controlled Experiments"](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2784774986?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true). I was a research intern at [Google Research](https://research.google/) and [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/). I publish under "Jie JW Wu". 

I have experience in industrial software development. I was a software engineer at [Snap Inc.](https://snap.com/en-US) and Microsoft in the Greater Seattle Area. 

**I'm actively looking for research opportunities in academia and industry. Do not hesitate to contact me for any opportunity to collaborate!**

## Research Interests
In the era of Big Data and Generative AI, I develop new approaches to simplify the complicated, time-consuming, and sometimes tedious process of software development and decision-making in a more systematic, formalized way. Led by this goal, my research interests are a) ***AI4SE*** and b) ***SE4AI*** within the context of Large Language Models (LLM), Machine Learning (ML), and Data as a component to assist, systematize and automate the decision-making of software developers and other roles within the enterprises. My previous experiences include but are not limited to the following areas:
- LLM-based approach for software development tasks
- Software development process for ML-enabled systems
- Continuous data-driven software engineering (online and offline A/B testing)
- Automated tooling to assist developers or end users
- Search-based software engineering (evolutionary algorithms) 
- Data-driven decision-making (multi-criteria decision-making)
- Recommender system (evaluation, candidate generation, ranking)
