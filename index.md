## About Me
My original name is _**Jie (Êù∞ in Chinese)**_. Please see this [link](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ji%C3%A9) with audio to learn how to pronunce Jie ("JEE-yeh" is pretty close). 

My undergraduate study ([ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home)) and master study were done both in Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I recieved my PhD in System Engineering at [George Washington University](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/). My thesis is titled ["Towards Formalizing Data-Driven Decision-Making from Big Data: A Systematic Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Approach in Online Controlled Experiments"](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2784774986?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true). I publish under "Jie JW Wu". 

I have experiences in industrial software development. I am currently a software engineer at [Snap Inc.](https://snap.com/en-US) 

## Research Interests
In the era of Big Data and AI, I develop new approaches to simplify the complicated, time-comsuming and sometimes tedious process of software development and decision-making in a more systematic, formalized way. Led by this goal, my research interests are
* automated techniques 
* AI4SE (AI for Software Engineering) 
* software evaluation 

that better understand and assist the decision-making of software developers and other roles within the enterprises.
