## About Me
My original first name is _**杰 (Jie)**_. Please see this [link](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ji%C3%A9) with audio to learn how to pronounce Jie ("JEE-yeh" is pretty close). I'm happy to accept any approximation, so please feel free to use your favorite variants! I also go by _**JW**_.

I'm a postdoc at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), working with [Dr. Fatemeh Fard](https://cmps.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/fatemeh-hendijani-fard/) at the intersection of GenAI and Software Engineering. My undergraduate and master studies were done both in Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/)  (at [ACM Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), an elite CS program at SJTU). I received my PhD in Systems Engineering at [George Washington University](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/). My PhD dissertation is titled ["Towards Formalizing Data-Driven Decision-Making from Big Data: A Systematic Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Approach in Online Controlled Experiments"](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2784774986?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true). I was a research intern at [Google Research](https://research.google/) and [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/). I publish under "Jie JW Wu". 

I worked as a software engineer in the industry for nearly a decade at [Snap Inc.](https://snap.com/en-US) (Seattle office), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) (Redmond HQ), and startup ([ArcSite](https://www.arcsite.com/), Shanghai office). I've worked in various areas such as ML-enabled recommender systems, data analysis, scalable backend service and infrastructure, mobile applications, etc.

## Research Interests
I develop new approaches to simplify the complicated, time-consuming, and sometimes tedious process of software development and decision-making in a more systematic, formalized way. Led by this goal, my research interests are a) ***AI4SE*** and b) ***SE4AI*** within the context of Large Language Models (LLM), Machine Learning (ML), and Data as a component to assist, systematize, and automate the decision-making of software developers and other roles within the enterprises. My work emphasizes using system thinking and bridging the gap between the industry and academia.

## Misc
Outside research and software engineering, I'm interested in the following topics, and I'm happy to talk about it if you find any of them interesting:
- [红楼梦 (Dream of the Red Chamber)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber): Arguably the best 18th-century Chinese novel that describes the rise and fall of 贾's family. I'm speechless about how great the realism is in the stories. Furthermore, on top of these highly realistic stories, a higher layer exists that implies Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism from Chinese philosophy!
- [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) and history of Relativity, Quantum Physics: If Einstein's deeds were written into a novel, I would not believe that it would happen in the real world!
- Basketball: I (used to) play every week
- Reading: with a general focus on History, Non-fiction, and Philosophy
