## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Biostatistics at Harvard University, working with Prof. Tianxi Cai and Junwei Lu. I graduated with a Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) in August 2022, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Hao Chen. Before that, I received my B.S. in Statistics and B.E. in Computer Science (dual) from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2019. 

I am interested in developing .  I'm also developing practical tools for analyzing high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data. Specifically, I am interested in reinforcement learning, transfer learning, high-dimensional statistics, network analysis, and graph- and rank-based methods.
