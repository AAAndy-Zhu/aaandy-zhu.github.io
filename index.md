## About Me
My original first name is _**杰 (Jie)**_. Please see this [link](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ji%C3%A9) with audio to learn how to pronounce Jie ("JEE-yeh" is pretty close). 

My undergraduate and master studies were done both in Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/)  (at [ACM Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), an elite CS program at SJTU). I received my PhD in Systems Engineering at [George Washington University](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/). My PhD dissertation is titled ["Towards Formalizing Data-Driven Decision-Making from Big Data: A Systematic Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Approach in Online Controlled Experiments"](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2784774986?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true). I was a research intern at [Google Research](https://research.google/) and [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/). I publish under "Jie JW Wu". 

I worked as a software engineer for 8+ years at [Snap Inc.](https://snap.com/en-US) (Seattle office), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) (Redmond HQ), and startup ([ArcSite](https://www.arcsite.com/), Shanghai office). I've worked on various areas such as ML-enabled recommender systems, data analysis, scalable backend service and infrastructure, mobile applications, etc.

**⚡ Nov 2023:** I will attend [MAPS 2023](https://mapsworkshop.github.io/papers) on Dec 3, 2023, in San Francisco, US to present my work on the [communication skills of LLM](https://mapsworkshop.github.io/papers). Looking forward to the event! I gratefully thank NSF for the travel support award.

**⚡ Nov 2023:** I will be a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [University of British Columbia, Canada](https://www.ubc.ca/), working with [Dr. Fard](https://cmps.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/fatemeh-hendijani-fard/) at the intersection of Software Engineering and AI!


## Research Interests
I develop new approaches to simplify the complicated, time-consuming, and sometimes tedious process of software development and decision-making in a more systematic, formalized way. Led by this goal, my research interests are a) ***AI4SE*** and b) ***SE4AI*** within the context of Large Language Models (LLM), Machine Learning (ML), and Data as a component to assist, systematize, and automate the decision-making of software developers and other roles within the enterprises. My work emphasizes using system thinking and bridging the gap between the industry and academia.
