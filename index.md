## About Me
My original name is _**Jie (Êù∞ in Chinese)**_. Please see this [link](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ji%C3%A9) with audio to learn how to pronunce Jie ("JEE-yeh" is pretty close). 

My undergraduate study (ACM Honors Class) and master study were done at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I recieved my PhD in System Engineering at George Washington University. I am a software engineer at Snap Inc. I publish under "Jie JW Wu". 

## Research Interests
I'm interested in software engineering research. Currently, my main interests are AI4SE (AI for Software Engineering) and Evaluation of Software (such as online and offline A/B testing, evalulation of recommender systems, decision making from business and software perspectives, etc.).
